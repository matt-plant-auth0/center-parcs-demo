<h2><span class="h3"><a id="192"></a>Adapted lodge 192<br />
</span></h2>
<p>This is a three-bedroom single storey Woodland lodge. The makeup of the non-adapted rooms is a double bedroom and a twin bedroom. The adapted bedroom is made up of two single beds. The front door width is 82cm. There is a chain on the front door at 178cm from the floor. This is to prevent small children leaving the lodge without the guardian / parentâs knowledge.</p>
<p>There are emergency pull cords in the adapted bed room and en-suite bath room these are local alarms and can be heard in the lodge they are not connected to a central point.</p>
<p>There is an external charging point outside the bedroom emergency exit.</p>
<p>The lodge is located close to the Plaza building. Access to the Plaza is via a steep path with a 14% decline. There is an alternative route that avoids this path. It is through the hotel reception and down the lift this would take you into the main building. There are various paths around village which have steep inclines. Please see the Around the Village tab on Access for All for further information.</p>
<h3><strong><span class="h5">Parking</span></strong></h3>
<p>Designated accessible parking is provided by the accommodation. One space per lodge. This is to assist loading and unloading. You will still be required to remove your vehicle to the car park once you have loaded your vehicle or unloaded it. As all other guests are.<strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong><span class="h5">Access inside the lodge</span></strong></h3>
<p>There is access for guests using wheelchairs throughout the accommodation. This includes into the other bedroom, although there is limited manoeuvring space once in the non-adapted bedroom.</p>
<h3><strong><span class="h5">Lounge</span></strong></h3>
